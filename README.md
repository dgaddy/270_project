# CS270 Final Project
#### David Gaddy, Samee Ibraheem, and Daniel Filan

This repository holds the code for our CS270 final project.
We implemented dual decomposition for alignment models based on the paper *Model-Based Aligner Combination Using Dual Decomposition*
by John DeNero and Klaus Macherey.
Take a look at the jupyter notebook [here](Project%20Description%20and%20Visualizations.ipynb) to see some of our results.
Or look [here](our_align_dual.py) to see the code.
